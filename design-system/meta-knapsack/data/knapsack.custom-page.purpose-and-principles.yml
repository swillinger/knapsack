        ### Design Purpose


        Bring the many sources of truth together.


        ### Design Principles


        #### Presentation Over UI Design


        Knapsack celebrates the user’s system and content. Knapsack's UI will be
        as unobtrusive and themeable as possible so that the user’s content and
        brand style can shine.


        #### In Context


        Controls for editing content will be on or around the content in as
        close proximity as possible. No modals allowed. Same goes for help text
        and links to documentation, specifically when a user can edit.


        #### Choice Over Direction


        While we may provide initial guidance or sane defaults, Knapsack users
        get the final say in how their system functions. When designing
        features, we opt to provide choice and flexibility over specific
        methodology where possible.


        #### Familiar is Friendly


        We use widely embraced UI/X paradigms to minimize the learning curve for
        users. We're selective about doing something new and will exercise
        restraint when doing something new isn't demonstrably better.


        #### Lead by Example


        We use Knapsack's design to expose users to usability best practices in
        order to ultimately help them understand and build better products.
