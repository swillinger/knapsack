title: Organizing Left Navigation
---

Knapsack allows you to organize the navigation for your design system however you want. The left navigation structure is completely decoupled from the folder structure of coded components and you can nest items infinitely.

_Note: You must be logged in or working locally to edit the left nav structure_

Start by clicking the edit button at the bottom right of the left nav.

You'll notice that each nav item now has a drag handle to the left of it. Click and drag any item to rearrange it's placement, move the item left or right to control it's nested placement.

You can add folders for the sake of organization from the Add button at the bottom left.

When you're happy with the organizational changes, be sure to save. Cancel to clear any organizational changes you've made.
