title: Editing Pattern Metadata Through the UI
---
Knapsack gives the non-technical user the ability to edit the pattern metadata that determines pattern configuration.



Whenever you see the edit button:

You can change the data on the page, then propose a change using the "Propose Change" menu item on the top site nav.

If you don't see edit buttons and you don't have the "Propose Change" item, make sure you're logged in.

Making a change through the UI in this way will trigger the creation of a git commit and a Pull Request on Github that can be reviewed and then "merged" (incorporated into the codebase) by a developer.
