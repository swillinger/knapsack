## Welcome to Knapsack! ✨

Knapsack is an open source, scalable platform ideal for multi-brand design systems. With Knapsack, you can get your own design system up and running quickly.

## What is a design system?

The concept goes by many names, some that you may have heard of include pattern library, atomic design, or design language. In essence a design system is a series of components that can be reused in different combinations. Design systems allow you to manage design at scale and to mix and match "design building blocks" to easily create a variety of experiences.

## History

Knapsack is the brain child of Evan Lovely, the CTO at Basalt and has worked on another open source project, Pattern Lab. Over the past few years, Evan and the rest of the Basalt team have gleaned new ideas from implementing design systems for several industries across the spectrum of their business. This has allowed the team to examine how to improve their techniques to best serve large organizations.

It became apparent that tools on the market had enforced an unnecessary ceiling for teams looking to build a robust and flexible design system. This ends up being a common barrier for organizations managing more than a few digital properties or brands.

Thus, the earliest iteration of this project, Bedrock, was born. As it grew (and after a rather amusing situation with a product by the same name) we realized that our brand should be more in line with our goal. Knapsack was born out of a thought exercise known as "The Knapsack Problem".

The Knapsack Problem refers to having a knapsack that has a definite carrying capacity, along with and a set amount of objects each with a different size and weight. The question becomes, how do you optimize packing with the best configuration possible? This is what we aim to provide — the tools to navigate this scenario in the simplest terms for even the most complicated of combinations.

## Who uses Knapsack?

Knapsack is primarily used by front end developers, but provides immediate benefit to designers, product owners, project managers, and content producers.

## Ongoing Use

After the components are created in Knapsack, the platform can be used every day to maintain, evolve, and prune your design system. Benefits of this adoption includes:

* Rapid implementation and modification of components, across all properties and brands
* Expand and prune your library through introduction and deprecation of patterns
* Integrate sub-brands into the global design system at your own pace
* Prototyping for Designers and Content Managers
* Understanding context, design intent and user journeys per digital property
* Managing versions at the component level
* Integrate new employees and contracted agencies quickly
