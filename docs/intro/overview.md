## Welcome to Knapsack! âœ¨

An open source, scalable platform that is ideal for multi-brand design systems, with Knapsack, you can get your own design system up and running quickly.

What is a design system? The concept goes by many names you may have heard of, pattern library, atomic design, or design language, but in essence a design system is a series of components that can be reused in different combinations. Design systems allow you to manage design at scale, mixing and matching pieces to different effect.

## History

Knapsack is the brain child of one Evan Lovely, CTO for Basalt and co-maintainer of another open source project, Pattern Lab. Over the past few years, he and the rest of the Basalt team have gleaned new ideas from implementing design systems for several industries across the spectrum of their business. Examining different ways to improve their technique to serve large organizations to the fullest extent possible.

What they found is the current tools on the market enforce an unnecessary ceiling for teams looking to build a robust and flexible design system. This barrier is commonly found by organizations that manage more than a few digital properties or sub-brands.

Thus the earliest iteration of this project, Bedrock, was born, but as it grew (and after a rather amusing situation with a product by the same name) we realized that our brand should be more in line with our goal. Knapsack was born out of an thought excercise known as "The Knapsack Problem".

If you have a knapsack with a definite carrying capacity, and a set ammount of objects each with a different size and weight, how do you optimize packing with the best configuration possible? This is what we aim to provide, the tools to navigate this senario in the simplest terms for even the most complicated of combinations.

## What is Knapsack?

Knapsack is an API-first framework, and the foundation for your single source of truth. This includes the ability to hold:

\- Coded components, organized, and language-agnostic

\- Documentation for Design Tokens, Brand Standards, Usage, and Version History Context

\- Page Builder, a prototyping function to display and assemble component variants into a full experience (great for tight iteration loops and on-the-fly creative brainstorms w/the broader DS team)

\- A flexible, open API allowing for integrations with design tools, documentation software, and project management systems

## Who uses Knapsack?

Knapsack is primarily used by front end developers, but provides immediate benefit to designers, product owners, content producers, and project managers.

## Ongoing Use

After the components are created in Knapsack, the platform can be used every day to maintain, evolve, and prune your design system. Benefits of this adoption includes:

- Rapid implementation and modification of components, across all properties and brands
- Expand and prune your library through introduction and deprecation of patterns
- Integrate sub-brands into the global design system at your own pace
- Prototyping for Designers and Content Managers
- Understanding context, design intent and user journeys per digital property
- Managing versions at the component level
- Integrate new employees and contracted agencies quickly
