Slices are a way of adding sections to pages in Knapsack. They are flexible tools that let you build out docs in a variety of predefined ways. All users with access to Knapsack can see the slices within each page, but only users with appropriate permissions can create and edit slices.

## Creating a new slice

Navigate to any page in Knapsack, either select it from the top of the page or scroll to the bottom (depending on where you want to add it), and click the add.

From there, select a slice type.

## Editing a slice

After creating a new slice or clicking "edit slices" on any page, you can alter a slice based on its type. For example, here is the markdown slice.
