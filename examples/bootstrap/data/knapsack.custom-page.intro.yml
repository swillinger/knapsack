        Get started with Bootstrap, the world’s most popular framework for
        building responsive, mobile-first sites, with BootstrapCDN and a
        template starter page.


        # Introduction


        ### CSS


        Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other
        stylesheets to load our CSS.


        ### JS


        Many of our components require the use of JavaScript to function.
        Specifically, they require jQuery, Popper.js, and our own JavaScript
        plugins. Place the following `<script>`s near the end of your pages,
        right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them. jQuery must come
        first, then Popper.js, and then our JavaScript plugins.


        We use jQuery’s slim build, but the full version is also supported.


        > Curious which components explicitly require jQuery, our JS, and
        Popper.js? Click the show components link below. If you’re at all unsure
        about the general page structure, keep reading for an example page
        template.


        ### Starter template


        Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development
        standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport
        meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your
        pages should look like this:


        ```html

        <!doctype html>

        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <!-- Required meta tags -->
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

            <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm" crossorigin="anonymous">

            <title>Hello, world!</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

            <!-- Optional JavaScript -->
            <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
            <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
            <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ApNbgh9B+Y1QKtv3Rn7W3mgPxhU9K/ScQsAP7hUibX39j7fakFPskvXusvfa0b4Q" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
            <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
          </body>
        </html>

        ```

        or our official examples to start laying out your site’s content and
        components.


        ### Important globals


        Bootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings that
        you’ll need to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost
        exclusively geared towards the normalization of cross browser styles.
        Let’s dive in.


        ##### HTML5 doctype


        Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you’ll see
        some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn’t cause any
        considerable hiccups.


        Bootstrap is developed mobile first, a strategy in which we optimize
        code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary
        using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming
        for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>`.


        ##### Box-sizing


        For more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing
        value from content-box to border-box. This ensures padding does not
        affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems
        with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search
        Engine.


        On the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the
        following:


        ```css

        .selector-for-some-widget {
          box-sizing: content-box;
        }

        ```


        With the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via
        ::before and ::after—will all inherit the specified box-sizing for that
        .selector-for-some-widget.

        ##### Reboot


        For improved cross-browser rendering, we use Reboot to correct
        inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly
        more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.
